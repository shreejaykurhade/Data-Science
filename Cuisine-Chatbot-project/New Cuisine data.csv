Cut the mangoes in half, deseed and further cut them into one inch cubes. You can leave the skin on provided they are tender and smooth. In a large steel bowl, combine the salt, turmeric powder and cut mangoes. Cover, the bowl and allow it to marinate for 1 hour.Heat a small pan on medium heat, and roast the coriander seeds until you start smelling the aroma. Turn off heat and allow it to cool. Once cooled, using a pestle and mortar to coarsely crush the coriander seeds to half.Blend the mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds into a coarse powder. There is no need to roast the seeds.To the marinated mangoes, add the powdered mustard and fenugreek seeds, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, kalonji seeds, and coriander seeds. Stir well to combine.Add 1 cup of mustard oil and stir well again. You don't need to heat the mustard oil. Check the salt at this stage. It should feel extra salt. If it is not extra salty, add a few tablespoon of salt until you get that extra salty taste. Salt and oil are the two most important preservatives in pickling. Cover the steel bowl with a muslin cloth and tie it tightly around the rim. This will absorb any residual moisture. Place a steel lid over the covered bowl and set aside.After 24 hours, open and give it a stir. Cover again with cloth wrapped tightly and a lid and set it to rest for another day. The third day you will notice the mangoes have softened. At this stage add the remaining 2 cups of mustard oil. Give it a stir. Once again cover tightly with muslin cloth and a steel lid. Keep it aside for 2 more days. Give it a stir.By the end of 5th day the pickle will be ready to eat. The mangoes would have softened but might still have a firm texture. The mangoes will keep marinating and softening when it is stored in bottles and will age with time. Moisture is the biggest killer for pickles. Clean and sterilize the bottles and the lids that you will be using for storage. I typically like to store them in multiple small 500 gram glass bottles, so I only open the bottle when i am ready to use it.Transfer the Punjabi Mango Pickle into the clean and dry bottles. Add a tablespoon of mustard oil on the top once filled and seal the bottle tight and enjoy.Use a clean dry spoon so that there is no moisture when you take the pickle out of the bottle.Serve Punjabi Mango Pickle  with Pyaz Ka Paratha Recipe or Aloo Methi Paratha Recipe for a  complete breakfast. "

Divide the dough into equal portions.Cover the ragi paratha dough and allow it to rest until you get the filling ready. The next step is to make the Paneer filling for the Ragi ParathaIn a mixing bowl, combine the grated paneer green chillies, freshly chopped mint leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into equal portions.This process of dividing and keeping the portions for paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the ragi paratha dough.Dust the ragi paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter.Take a portion of paneer filling and place it in the center. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled ragi paneer paratha dough down.Dust the filled paneer paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat skillet on medium heat and grease it with little oil. Place the filled ragi paneer paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Spread a little oil over the paratha and keep pressing the ragi paneer stuffed parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.Serve this Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe along with Spring Onion and Peanut Raita Recipe and Amla Achaar Recipe for a hearty and healthy high protein breakfast or an indian diabetic breakfast or lunch."

Releasing the pressure immediately, helps retain the fresh green color of the Gherkins and also gives it a perfectly cooked texture.Click here to watch the video of how to cook vegetables in a pressure cooker.Our next step is to make the Manoli Curry Masala. In a small pan; roast the dry red chillies, fenugreek, coriander, cumin and black pepper until you can smell the roasted aromas. Add these to a small blender jar, along with the coconut, tamarind and turmeric powder.Grind the spices adding very little water to make a smooth curry paste. The Manoli curry paste is now ready. Keep aside.In the next step; heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the chopped onions, and saute for a couple of minutes until the onions are soft and tender. Add the curry paste and saute for a couple of more minutes.Stir in the steamed gherkins, salt and add about 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water. You essentially want a thick gravy for the Manoli Curry; hence add water accordingly. Give all the ingredients a good stir. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste. Give the mixture a quick boil only when you are ready to serve. Serve the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe along with Whole Wheat Lachha Paratha and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for an everyday meal."

Pat it dry completely.Now grate the cauliflower completely and set it aside for a while. After about 10 minutes, cauliflower would have released a lot of water, squeeze it out and discard the water.Next, heat a pan and dry roast the grated cauliflower until it feels completely dry and contains no more moisture. While roasting it, take care not to cook it too much.

If the yeast doesn’t react discard it and start another batch.In another bowl, add flour, salt, oil and mix with your fingers, make a well in the center and pour in the frothy yeast mixture and yogurt. Mix well. We just want all the dry flour to be wet. The dough will be sticky.Thoroughly clean the counter surface, rub your fingers with little flour, transfer the dough onto the counter and start kneading. Initially it will be sticky. Knead until smooth, soft and shiny.The kneading should be “stretch, fold back” movements. Do not add too much flour while kneading. We need flour just to rub your fingers with in case dough is very difficult to handle. If you add more flour, the naan might not turn soft.Place the dough into a bowl rub oil all over the dough, and cover it with a damp cloth. Set it aside for 1 – 1.5 hours, for the dough to prove. After 1-1.5 hours the dough would have risen and it would be double the size.In a mixer grinder, coarsely blend the almonds and the raisins and keep aside. Optionally add the coconut as well. Once the dough is proven, knock it down (punch it with your fist), this is done to release all the air that would have collected. Gently knead for another 2 minutes.Divide the dough into equal parts (I made 3 large balls). Dust a little flour if needed to roll and press the dough.Sprinkle the dry fruits in the center. Now bring the edges of the peshwari naan to the center sealing the stuffing in the center. Now roll the peshwari naan into any desired shape making sure not to break the stuffing out of the naan.Sprinkle some kalonji over the peshwari naan and may be few almond flakes on top as well.Heat a tawa. Grease it well with ghee. Place the rolled peshwari naan and cook covered on low flame. You will see the naan bubbling up.Turn the peshwari naan the other side and rub ghee generously and cook.Keep turning peshwari naan once in 30 seconds to 1 minute on both sides until all edges are cooked and naan is browned on both sides.Remove the peshwari naan from tawa and again rub ghee generously on top.

Add chopped onions, garlic and ginger and sauté till onions turn translucent and lightly golden.Add grated coconut to the above onion and sauté till coconut turns golden brown. Remove the mixture from the heat and set aside to cool.Add the roasted spices, tamarind and onion-coconut mixture into the small jar of the Mixer Grinder and blend to make a smooth paste by adding little water. The next step is to make the Xacuti masala. Heat oil in a flat bottomed pan. Add the ground masala paste and saute for a few minutes. Add mushroom pieces, turmeric powder, salt to taste and give it a stir for a few seconds. Add just a little water to give the Goan Mushroom Xacuti a gravy like consistency and cover the pan.Simmer the Goan Mushroom Xacuti Masala for 3 to 4 minutes and turn off the heat. Mushrooms get cooked very quickly and also release a lot of water.Once done, turn off the heat and stir in the coriander leaves - it brings in a freshness to the Goan Mushroom Xacuti. Serve the Goan Mushroom Xacuti along with buttered pav puns or even a matar pulao for lunch or dinner."
